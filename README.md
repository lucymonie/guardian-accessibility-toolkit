<h1>Accessibility statement for The Guardian</h1>

<p>We want everyone who visits the The Guardian website to feel welcome and find the experience rewarding.</p>

<h2>What are we doing?</h2>

<p>To help us make the The Guardian website a positive place for everyone, we've been using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1</a>. These guidelines explain how to make web content more accessible for people with disabilities, and user friendly for everyone.</p>

<p>The guidelines have three levels of accessibility (A, AA and AAA). Weâ€™ve chosen Level AA as the target for the The Guardian website.</p>


<h2>How are we doing?</h2>

<p>We're working hard to achieve our goal of Level AA accessibility, but we realise there are some areas that still need improving. The following information explains what we're doing to make that happen.</p>
